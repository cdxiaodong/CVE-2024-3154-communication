# CVE-2024-3154-communication
how does it runï¼Ÿ

My idea is to create a specific format of bypass commands in annotations that result in parsing outside the host.

'''
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  annotations:
    execStart: "/usr/bin/somecommand"
    execStartPre: "/usr/bin/prepcommand"
    execReload: "/usr/bin/reloadcommand"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: example/image

Do you have any ideas to exchange?
